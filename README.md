# Silly Docker-based LAMP (Linux Apache Mysql PHP)

Very basic approach that's primarily designed to act as a snippet for simple development.

## Notes

- PHP with Apache server requires root as a user therefore it's currently not possible to use it with normal user

## Inspiration

- [laravel-apache-docker](https://github.com/veevidify/laravel-apache-docker/tree/master)

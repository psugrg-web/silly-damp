# Silly Docker-based LAMP (Linux Apache Mysql PHP)

Very basic approach that's primarily designed to act as a snippet for simple development.

> Remember to create `.env` file with configuration. You can use `.env.example` file as a starting point. Just use `cp .env.example .env`

## Notes

- PHP with Apache server requires root as a user therefore it's currently not possible to use it with normal user

## Inspiration
